# Solution for task 1 (Lasso) of lab assignment - FDA SS23 by [NAME]

# if necessary, write text as answer in comments or use a Jupyter notebook

# imports

# load data (change path if necessary)
# df = pd.read_csv("lasso_data.csv")

# Task 1.1 Is it possible to solve the lasso optimisation problem analytically? Explain. (3 points)


# Task 1.2 Split the data into a train and a test set with appropriate test size. (2 points)


# Task 1.3 Fit a linear regression model for Y using all remaining variables on the training data. (5 points)


# Task 1.4 Make a model prediction on unseen data and assess model performance using a suitable metric. (5 points)


# Task 1.5 Perform lasso regression using the same data as in task 1.3 (6 points)


# Task 1.6 Compare model performance to the original linear model by using the same metric and test set as in 1.4.
# What do you observe? (2 points)


# Task 1.7 Print out the model coefficients for both, the linear model and the lasso model. (2 points)


# Task 1.8 What do you observe comparing the estimated model coefficients? Was this result expected? (5 points)
# Hint: Look at the data generating process and lasso explanation to answer this question
